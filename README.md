# Fine-Tune-BERT-for-Text-Classification-with-TensorFlow


Course Objectives
In this course, we are going to focus on three learning objectives:

Build TensorFlow Input Pipelines for Text Data with the 
tf.data
 API 

Tokenize and Preprocess Text for 
BERT
   

Fine-tune BERT for text classification with TensorFlow and 
TensorFlow Hub
  

This is a guided project on fine-tuning a Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding (BERT) model for text classification with TensorFlow. In this 2 hour long project, you will learn to preprocess and tokenize data for BERT classification, build TensorFlow input pipelines for text data with the tf.data API, and train and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model for text classification with TensorFlow 2 and TensorFlow Hub. 

Prerequisites: In order to successfully complete this project, you should be competent in the Python programming language, be familiar with deep learning for Natural Language Processing (NLP), and have trained models with TensorFlow or and its Keras API. 

Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. Weâ€™re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.

Course Structure
This course is divided into 3 parts:

Course Overview: This introductory reading material.

Fine Tune BERT for Text Classification with TensorFlow: This is the hands on project that we will work on in Rhyme.

Graded Quiz: This is the final assignment that you need to pass in order to finish the course successfully.

Project Structure
The hands on project on Fine Tune BERT for Text Classification with TensorFlow is divided into following tasks:

Task 1: Introduction to the Project
Task 2:  Setup your TensorFlow and Colab Runtime
Task 3: Load the Quora Insincere Questions Dataset
Task 4: Create tf.data.Datasets for Training and Evaluation
Task 5: Download a Pre-trained BERT Model from TensorFlow Hub
Task 6: Tokenize and Preprocess Text for BERT
Task 7:  Wrap a Python Function into a TensorFlow op for Eager Execution
Task 8: Create a TensorFlow Input Pipeline with tf.data
Task 9: Add a Classification Head to the BERT hub.KerasLayer
Task 10: Fine-Tune BERT for Text Classification
Task 11: Evaluate the BERT Text Classification Model
